For those work teams out there that have trouble deciding on where to go to eat, this app is for you! What's for Lunch is an app that creates a poll

that allows its users to vote on where they would like to go from a random selection of restaurants in an area designated by the poll creator!

First you put in a valid City Name or Zip / Postal Code for an area where you would like to eat with a limited timer on the poll. The current poll timer is 5 Minutes but will be adjusted at a later date for long work days! Once the poll is created you can take the link and send it to your fellow team mebmers for them to vote on. A Poll comes with the name of the restaurant, it's address, and the area it is located ; Complete with a fully functional google map! 

Once you find a place you like, hit that vote button and it will take you to the current standings page. 
When the poll expires you can view this standings page to see which restaurant got the most votes and will be declared the winner.

Happy Eating!!
